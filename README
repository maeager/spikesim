BUILD

$ make

SETUP MPI

Start ssh-agent for fast passwordless implementation of multiple processors.

$ ssh-agent -s > ~/.ssh-agent
$ . ~/.ssh-agent

Check any log files left over from previous mpd.

$ mpdcleanup

Run the mpi daemon in background.

$ mpd &

Test the mpd.

$ mpdtrace
$ mpiringtest 100
$ mpiexec -n 2 hostname

EXAMPLE SIMULATION

Build the your executable
$ make ParSpikeSim.exe

The MPI version should be run in the background from a script or in batch mode, but these examples are in commandline mode.  The number of processors, nprocs, is requested by the user and depends on the capability of the system.  The './' at the start of the executable is necessary unless the current folder is in the PATH variable.
 
$ mpiexec -n nprocs  ./ParSpikeSim.exe > batch.log 2>&1 &

or you may need to submit the script to the SGI grid engine

$ qsub -q medium.q -b y -V -cwd -e /dev/null -o /dev/null mpiexec -n nprocs  ./ParSpikeSim.exe 

where medium.q is a queue.  If the grid engine has parallel features built in, eg. MPI,
